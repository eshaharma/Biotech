  * **Student mode**: View-only access to student records.
* Secure access for teachers (admin credentials: `admin` / `1234`)
* Subject-wise grade entry and display
* Persistent data storage using object serialization (`students.dat`)
* Simple, user-friendly graphical interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Java SE (Swing for GUI)
* Object Serialization for file storage
* Java Collections (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`)
